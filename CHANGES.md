We skipped a bunch of versions to get to the Ivy built, Angular-CLI based latest.
This was a big migration to a new structure and build process, so file a bug if you encounter any issues.

### 13.0.1
Minor cleanup in the project and removed an accidental dependency

## 8.1
Added call to Map.remove in OnDestroy handler.
This should ensure that any outstanding event handlers are cleaned up.
Added demo example for adding/removing maps dynamically. 

## 8.0
Support for Angular.io 10.

## 7.0
Support for Angular.io 9. 🎉

- Are your markers broken? In Leaflet 1.6, the marker icons changed enough to create new hashes. See [README](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet/blob/master/README.md#a-note-about-markers) for more details.
- Renamed UMD bundle to `ngx-leaflet.umd.js`. This shouldn't affect anyone unless you're manually including the bundle.
- Angular deprecated parameterless forRoot, so I removed the static function. You may need to update your import.

Cleanup in the README.
