/**
 * Layers directive
 *
 * This directive is used to directly control map layers. As changes are made to the input array of
 * layers, the map is synched to the array. As layers are added or removed from the input array, they
 * are also added or removed from the map. The input array is treated as immutable. To detect changes,
 * you must change the array instance.
 *
 * Important Note: The input layers array is assumed to be immutable. This means you need to use an
 * immutable array implementation or create a new copy of your array when you make changes, otherwise
 * this directive won't detect the change. This is by design. It's for performance reasons. Change
 * detection of mutable arrays requires diffing the state of the array on every DoCheck cycle, which
 * is extremely expensive from a time complexity perspective.
